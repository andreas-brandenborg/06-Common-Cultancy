        <h1>Russia Invades Ukraine</h1>
        <p>Thursday, February 24th 2022, Ukraine is invaded by Russia.<br>
            The media is flooded with posts, prayers, and fundraisers - the World wants to help!<br>
            Years go by and the war continues; unfortunately, media coverage does not. While Ukraine fights on against the largest country on Earth, social media moves on.
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to highlight the development <!-- Et bedre ord for 'udvikling'? --> of social media interactions on posts concerning the war in Ukraine.</p>

            As we navigate through the data, it's important to pause and
            consider what these numbers truly represent. The interaction
            trends tell a story that is bigger than just numbers—it’s about
            engagement, awareness, and the urgency to keep Ukraine in the global
            conversation.

        <h1>Support for Ukraine is Clear, But...</h1>
        <p>
            Since 2022, only 12,338 posts have been categorized as
            "against" Ukraine—a small fraction compared to those that
            are neutral or supportive. This indicates that the general
            sentiment on social media favors Ukraine. However, the challenge
            isn’t opposition—it’s the lack of engagement. The difference in
            attention given to these posts is staggering, revealing a troubling
            disparity in how we amplify voices of support.

        <p>
            This section highlights the distribution of sentiment across posts about Ukraine.
            While a majority of posts are supportive, the engagement metrics tell a different story.
            The attention given to posts with negative sentiments vastly outweighs the engagement on
            supportive content. This is not just a numbers issue; it’s a call for action to amplify the right voices.

            Numbers alone won’t win a war, but they can shape narratives.
            The power of social media lies in its ability to generate momentum,
            encourage donations, and pressure governments into action.
            This is why the imbalance in engagement is so crucial to
            address—without equal attention, the voices of support
            risk fading into the background.

            This section showcases the average shares on posts with "For" and
            "Imod" sentiments over the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. The
            disparity is striking. Posts with "Imod" sentiments
            consistently outperform supportive posts in engagement.
            This gap reflects a critical weakness in our efforts to rally
            support and keep Ukraine at the forefront of the digital narrative.

        <h1>From Social Media to Economic Support</h1>
        <p>
            While social media posts obviously don't directly help Ukraine, we will argue that voicing an issue will result in action from your government.
            Social media posts help shaping the public opinion and pressures governments to act.
            Highlighting the war's human cost and Ukraine's resilience amplify global awareness and solidarity, creating an environment where citizens demand action from their leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
            This grassroots mobilization often translates into political advocacy, prompting governments to allocate resources, impose sanctions on aggressors,
            or increase aid to Ukraine. Furthermore, viral social media campaigns can inspire coordinated efforts among nations and international organizations,
            reinforcing the narrative that collective action is necessary. While social media posts themselves are not economic contributions, they play a critical role
            in mobilizing the political will that ultimately results in tangible financial and material support.
