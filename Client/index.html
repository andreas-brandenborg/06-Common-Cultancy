            <h1>Russia Invades Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Thursday, February 24th 2022, Ukraine is invaded by Russia.<br>
                The media is flooded with posts, prayers, and fundraisers - the World wants to help!<br>
                Years go by and the war continues; unfortunately, media coverage does not. While Ukraine fights on against the largest country on Earth, social media moves on.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to highlight the development <!-- Et bedre ord for 'udvikling'? --> of social media interactions on posts concerning the war in Ukraine.</p>

            <p>Since 2022, there has been 12.338 post against Ukraine. This is a lesser ammount compared to post who are neutral or pro-Ukraine. This means that the generel people who post on Facebook do not show affinity towards Russia. The problem, however, is the difference in attention.</p>

            <h1>From Social Media to Economic Support</h1>
            <p>
                While social media posts obviously don't directly help Ukraine, we will argue that voicing an issue will result in action from your government.
                Social media posts help shaping the public opinion and pressures governments to act.
                Highlighting the war's human cost and Ukraine's resilience amplify global awareness and solidarity, creating an environment where citizens demand action from their leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                This grassroots mobilization often translates into political advocacy, prompting governments to allocate resources, impose sanctions on aggressors,
                or increase aid to Ukraine. Furthermore, viral social media campaigns can inspire coordinated efforts among nations and international organizations,
                reinforcing the narrative that collective action is necessary. While social media posts themselves are not economic contributions, they play a critical role
                in mobilizing the political will that ultimately results in tangible financial and material support.
