            <h1>Russia Invades Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Thursday, February 24th 2022, Ukraine is invaded by Russia.<br>
                The media is flooded with posts, prayers, and fundraisers - the World wants to help!<br>
                Years go by and the war continues; unfortunately, media coverage does not. While Ukraine fights on against the largest country on Earth, social media moves on.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to highlight the development <!-- Et bedre ord for 'udvikling'? --> of social media interactions on posts concerning the war in Ukraine.</p>

            <div id="2022">
                <h1>The Deceptive Drills: The Build-up Begins</h1>
                <p>Russia’s tanks moved toward Ukraine’s border, disguised as military drills. The world was on edge as the clock ticked down. It wasn’t a question of “if” anymore—it was a question of “when.”</p>

                <h1>The Geneva Ultimatum</h1>
                <p>In Geneva, Russia demanded Ukraine stay out of NATO. A simple demand that set the gears of war in motion. Diplomatic efforts failed, and the world watched as Russia began its deadly march forward.</p>

                <h1>History Repeats: Crimea’s Annexation</h1>
                <p>Putin’s playbook from 2014 was the same: force, manipulation, and annexation. This time, it was Ukraine. The world was shocked, but Russia moved forward, taking the first step toward a broader conflict.</p>

                <h1>A Nation Under Attack</h1>
                <p>The invasion was no longer a threat. It was a reality. As Russian missiles tore through Ukrainian cities, the country faced its darkest hour. Families were torn apart, but the spirit of Ukraine remained unbroken.</p>

                <h1>Zelenskyy’s Defiance</h1>
                <p>With Russian forces closing in, President Zelenskyy rejected the offer to flee. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” he said. His defiance echoed across the world and became the battle cry for a nation’s fight for freedom.</p>

                <h1>Snake Island: ‘Russian Warship, Go F* Yourself’</h1>
                <p>On Snake Island, Ukrainian soldiers gave a simple, defiant answer to Russia’s demand to surrender: “Russian warship, go f* yourself.” The soldiers became heroes, and their words rang out as a symbol of resistance.</p>

                <h1>Crisis at Chernobyl</h1>
                <p>In the early days of the war, Russia took control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The occupation exposed Russian troops to dangerous radiation, and the risk of environmental disaster loomed over Europe. The world watched as the dark history of Chernobyl resurfaced in the midst of war.</p>

                <h1>Nord Stream Pipeline Sabotage: A Strategic Blow</h1>
                <p>In September 2022, explosions rocked the Nord Stream pipelines, a major source of Russian gas to Europe. While the culprits remained unknown, the attack was widely viewed as a blow to Russian energy power. It marked a critical shift in the conflict, highlighting Ukraine’s ability to strike deep into Russia’s infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Winter came, and with it, Russia’s attempt to break Ukraine’s resolve through power outages and missile strikes. But Ukrainians gathered in basements, lit candles, and sang carols. The spirit of the nation could not be extinguished.</p>

                <h1>Crimean Bridge Attack</h1>
                <p>Ukraine delivered a blow to Russia’s logistical backbone, blowing up the Crimean Bridge. This attack disrupted Russian supplies and was a reminder that Ukraine could strike deep into enemy territory.</p>

                <h1>Global Solidarity</h1>

                <p>In June 2023, the Wagner Group rebelled against Russia’s military leadership. The brief mutiny exposed the cracks in Russia’s war effort and ended with the death of Prigozhin, marking the collapse of a powerful mercenary group.</p>

                <p>Ukraine’s power grids were targeted in a new phase of the war. Russia’s missile strikes created blackouts, but Ukrainians adapted and found ways to survive the harsh winter.</p>

                <p>As the war in Ukraine raged on, the eruption of violence in Gaza in 2023 pulled attention away from Eastern Europe. The violence spread further, tearing at the fabric of international solidarity. Two wars, two fronts, but one world struggling to find peace.</p>

            <h1>From Social Media to Economic Support</h1>
            <p>
                While social media posts obviously don't directly help Ukraine, we will argue that voicing an issue will result in action from your government.
                Social media posts help shaping the public opinion and pressures governments to act.
                Highlighting the war's human cost and Ukraine's resilience amplify global awareness and solidarity, creating an environment where citizens demand action from their leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                This grassroots mobilization often translates into political advocacy, prompting governments to allocate resources, impose sanctions on aggressors,
                or increase aid to Ukraine. Furthermore, viral social media campaigns can inspire coordinated efforts among nations and international organizations,
                reinforcing the narrative that collective action is necessary. While social media posts themselves are not economic contributions, they play a critical role
                in mobilizing the political will that ultimately results in tangible financial and material support.
            </p>
